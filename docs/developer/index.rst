Developer Guide
===============

Spur is a Rust workspace (Cargo) that builds four binaries — ``spurctld``,
``spurd``, ``spurstepd``, and ``spur``. This guide covers working on it.

- :doc:`building` — build from source, run the unit and end-to-end test suites.
  The end-to-end tests need real hardware.
- :doc:`documentation` — build and preview these docs locally.
- :doc:`contributing` — commit and pull-request conventions, license headers, and
  the pre-commit hook.
- :doc:`renewable-qos-design` — the guarded renewal contract, its timeout fencing
  prerequisites, and the validation gates. Disabled by default; see
  :doc:`../admin-guide/configuration` for the ``[renewal]`` keys.
