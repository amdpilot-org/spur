"""End-to-end tests for the raw WireGuard mesh, driven over real `wg` interfaces.

Mesh bring-up with no k0s: 1 controller + N workers join the mesh and every node
reaches every other over the mesh IPs (controller↔worker AND worker↔worker). The
k0s-over-mesh scenarios live in ``test_wg_k0s.py``.

The ``raw_wg_mesh`` fixture stands up the mesh per test and skips when a node
can't run a real WireGuard data plane.
